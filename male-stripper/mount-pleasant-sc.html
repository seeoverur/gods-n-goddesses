Mount Pleasant's location provides stunning natural beauty with the Cooper River to the west, Charleston Harbor to the south, and numerous tidal creeks threading through the landscape.

During colonial times, Mount Pleasant SC served primarily as an agricultural area with plantations growing rice and indigo, the cash crops that drove the Lowcountry economy. The town played roles in both the Revolutionary War and Civil War, with several historic sites throughout Mount Pleasant commemorating these important periods.</p>

        <p>The shrimping industry fundamentally shaped Mount Pleasant's character for much of the 20th century, with <a href="shem-creek.html">Shem Creek</a> emerging as one of the most important shrimping harbors on the East Coast.
